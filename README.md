## MSK Open Monitoring with AMP and AMG

Monitoring is a critical aspect of maintaining the health and performance of any distributed system. In the case of Apache Kafka-based applications, having robust monitoring capabilities becomes even more crucial due to the real-time nature of data processing. To address this need, we can have an integrated solution that combines Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) with the power of Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) and Amazon Managed Grafana (AMG). You can monitor your MSK cluster with Prometheus, an open-source monitoring system for time-series metric data. You can publish this data to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus using Prometheus's remote write feature. You can also use tools that are compatible with Prometheus-formatted metrics or tools that integrate with Amazon MSK Open Monitoring. The blog post will be helping to achieve this.
